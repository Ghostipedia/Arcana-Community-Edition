# Arcana Community Edition
Continuation of Arcana for 1.20.1 Forge

Arcana is a magic-themed Minecraft mod, and an unofficial successor to Thaumcraft. 

## DISCLAIMER: THE ORIGINAL PROJECT CEASED DEVELOPMENT
### AND  THE FORK/COMMUNITY VERSION IS A PASSION PROJECT OF A SINGLE PERSON

**Do not expect anything from this, in fact assume this repo just a hobby/testing ground for me to learn.

I am more than open to working with others to revive this project, however for now it is just me.

## Opening Arcana 
in its current state Arcana was left very unfinished. So there are a ton of bugs. again support cannot be offered to what there is. but here's how to get it working on your side:

Simply clone the git repo and open `build.gradle` with your IDE of your choice. Run `genIntellijRuns` or `genEclipseRuns` (or VS Code runs for the 1 person who uses that), and restart your IDE to get run configs. (Eclipse users may also need to edit their run configs; check the forge docs.)

In IntelliJ, you may also need to turn off IntelliJ's annotation processing (which Gradle handles), if you get "missing refmap" errors.
Go to Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> Annotation Processors -> (in the list) Gradle Imported -> Arcana-1.15.main -> Turn off "Enable annotation processing".
